üîπ Specialties: Wearables, Generative AI, Augmented Reality (AR), Spatial Computing
üîπ Previous Experience: Sidewalk Labs, Facebook, Google
üîπ Education: Bachelors of Design / MBA
üîπ Interests: Real time interactions, Immersive Experiences, Design Tools, React Three Fiber, Node.js, Figma Plugins

üëã Hi, I'm a Senior Product Designer at Meta, pushing the boundaries of AI, Augmented Reality, and Spatial Computing. My career started in graphic design, creating interactive Flash websites, which sparked my passion for blending design with technology. Out of an interest to help great experiences manifest in the world I pursued an MBA, and later, dove into the startup ecosystem where I learned about bootstraping markets, focusing on value for people, and just generally being scrappy.

At Meta, I'm fortunate to work on cutting-edge projects in AR and AI, exploring how these technologies can help people get things done in their daily lives. I previously worked on real time calling and sharing experiences across Messenger, Instagram, and Facebook.

I'm particularly excited about the potential of AI to revolutionize how we interact with the real world. I think this is even more powerful when we make the tools for creating new experiences available to evermore developers. My interest in location-based immersive experiences has led me to  develop immersive experiences and escape rooms with my friends and family in Toronto. I also love to contribute and build tools such as Figma plugins and applications using React Three Fiber.

I believe in the power of real-time collaboration. Moving from sending messages to working together on live models changes everything. It turns our interactions into dynamic conversations, making the creative process more inclusive and effective.

üåê Future Projects I Dream About:
> An immersive audio adventure experience around Toronto with puzzles at interesting sites.
> Creating a walkie talkie network for my kid and his friends.
> Reviving the landline calling experience of a corded phone.
> Creating a social radio station where listeners influence the playlist.
> Hosting live podcast sessions where listeners can interact and ask questions.
> Designing party music apps that allow live call-ins and song requests.
> Developing platforms where people can play games like chess while sharing music or other content.
> Let's connect if you're interested in transforming how we interact with technology and each other in this rapidly evolving digital landscape.",Product Designer at Facebook,"Greater Toronto Area, Canada",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQHN8WXkM0wGrg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1541007170358?e=1728518400&v=beta&t=j4howtuFnWQ7v1yT6wlh8yUb7K7Mgxv0xa8S-d1otx4,Patrick,Keenan,Patrick Keenan,3rd,ACoAAAA8oJEBAEN4v1DJ0pvo0v6q6dsCCGqbUg4,3973265,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAA8oJEBAEN4v1DJ0pvo0v6q6dsCCGqbUg4,name",2697,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAA8oJEBAEN4v1DJ0pvo0v6q6dsCCGqbUg4%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAA8oJEBAEN4v1DJ0pvo0v6q6dsCCGqbUg4%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,false,false,false,Meta,https://www.linkedin.com/company/10667/,Product Designer,Aug 2020 - Present,2020-08-01,true,4 yrs 1 mo,Secret City Adventures,https://www.linkedin.com/company/24799153/,Advisor / Contributor,Apr 2014 - Present,2014-04-01,true,10 yrs 5 mos,University of Oxford,https://www.linkedin.com/company/4477/,"MBA, Business & Social Entrepreneurship",2010 - 2011,,"jQuery, PHP, Graphic Design, Business Strategy, Open Innovation, Interaction Design, Information Architecture, User Experience, Drupal, Wordpress, JavaScript, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Marketing Strategy, Experience Design, Concept Development, Product Management, Information Design, Front-end Development, User Interface Design, Web Design, Research, Creative Direction, Web Development, Advertising, Digital Strategy, Multimedia, HTML, CSS, CMS, ActionScript, python, Flash, WordPress",jQuery,2,PHP,1,Graphic Design,38,Business Strategy,11,Open Innovation,3,Interaction Design,46,https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickkeenan/,patrickkeenan,2024-08-04T02:49:21.078Z,,,,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada ¬∑ Remote","Toronto, Canada Area",York University,https://www.linkedin.com/company/167012/,,2001 - 2005,"2020‚Äì2021: Rooms & link based calling

I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic Product Designer with a strong passion for 3D and AR/VR design. I enjoy combining my artistic background with my technical skills to create innovative and creative solutions. I have experience developing visionary concepts, conducting user research, and establishing product frameworks through the use of animated and interactive prototypes. Possessing a positive attitude and a growth-oriented mindset, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills as a designer.","Product Designer @ Duolingo | Prev. @ Meta, Samsung","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E03AQFOcRPQBWu5hQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1687711896616?e=1728518400&v=beta&t=Wqu68tclZJef-9VG8BKLET9dSosmjrOoH2TbA6EftjY,Leah,Lee,Leah Lee,3rd,ACoAAB3kYsgBfMxXGhMR_pt1u5PF39hbdwZBZN4,501506760,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAB3kYsgBfMxXGhMR_pt1u5PF39hbdwZBZN4,name",1881,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAB3kYsgBfMxXGhMR_pt1u5PF39hbdwZBZN4%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAB3kYsgBfMxXGhMR_pt1u5PF39hbdwZBZN4%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,false,false,false,Duolingo,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2973736/,Product Designer,May 2023 - Present,2023-05-01,true,1 yr 4 mos,Samsung Research America (SRA),https://www.linkedin.com/company/78467539/,Interaction Designer,Jan 2023 - May 2023,2023-01-01,false,5 mos,Carnegie Mellon University,https://www.linkedin.com/company/3147/,"Master's degree, Entertainment Technology (Computer Graphics)",,leah-lee.com/,"UX design, Figma, Graphic design, Adobe Creative Suite",UX design,16,Figma,1,Graphic design,15,Adobe Creative Suite,10,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/leahleeart/,leahleeart,2024-08-04T02:50:38.035Z,,,,,"Mountain View, California, United States",School of the Art Institute of Chicago,https://www.linkedin.com/company/10843099/,,,,"Designed social interaction for an AI-powered digital human in a virtual environment.
