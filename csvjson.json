    "description": "I am a highly motivated individual who loves all things mechatronics and constantly loves learning new things whenever I can. When I'm not doing school I am usually in my lab building something. A few of my favorite projects include a six degrees of freedom robotic arm with an original operating system, fuel injected 3D printable rocket engine as well as a go-cart made from an old generator. My dream is to become an entrepreneur creating technology that will benefit people on a global scale. To push myself in this direction I started my own 3D printing and consulting business at age sixteen. Although this business didn't take off I learned a lot from it and other similar experiences. If you are looking for an enthusiastic person who will work relentlessly and is always eager to learn, I am your guy.",
